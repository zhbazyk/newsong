Blood gushes from the wound
The cut is wide and deep
And before I turn around
He falls to his knees
A clear song rings in the blade
When steel meets hardened steel
I hear the sound of wood that breaks
A swords cuts through my shield
I drop the shield and grab my axe
A weapon in each fist
The first blow makes the helmet crack
The axe cut to the teeth
I rip the axe from the head
Covered in blood and brains
Leave the body lying dead
Ready to strike again
